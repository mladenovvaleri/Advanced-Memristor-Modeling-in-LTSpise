# Memristor-based Neuron with activation function, realized with MOS transistors and memristor

* A new and simple memristor-based neuron with activation function with memristor and MOS transistors
* with application in artificial neural networks proposed
* with inputs for positive and negative synaptic weights
* with adders, based on aoperational amplifiers and memristors
* analyzed and verified in both LTSPICE and MATLAB
